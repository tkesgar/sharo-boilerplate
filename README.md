This is a dependency package for [sharo][sharo] boilerplate, which bundles several packages such as [Next.js][next], [node-sass][node-sass] and [Express][express] into a single dependency package.

This makes maintenance somewhat easier by simply doing `npm update sharo-scripts`. The content of `package.json` also becomes less cluttered, which is a good thing ðŸ‘Œ. `sharo-scripts` also includes some useful **mods** and **middlewares** you can use in your apps (see [sharo docs][sharo] for information about sharo mods and middlewares).
