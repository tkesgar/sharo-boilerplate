> **Note:** This package is currently in development and does not follow semver.

This is the dependency package for [sharo][sharo] boilerplate, just like `react-scripts` in
`create-react-app`. I create this to make maintenance of my Node.js apps easier (simply update a
single package).

## Usage

Please refer to [sharo][sharo] for detailed documentations, usage, and examples.

For information of what each module does, please refer to the code. Most of them are just a few
lines of wrapper codes; there are more comment lines than the code itself.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcomed but should be limited to code maintenance, bugfixes, or
dependency updates. For feature requests, please send it at [sharo][sharo] instead.
